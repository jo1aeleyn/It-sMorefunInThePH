	<p>The Philippines is the only country in Southeast Asia that was subjected to Western colonization before it had the opportunity to 
		develop either a centralized government ruling over a large territory or a dominant culture. In ancient times the inhabitants of 
		the Philippines were a diverse agglomeration of peoples who arrived in various waves of immigration from the Asian mainland and who 
		maintained little contact with each other. Contact with Chinese traders was recorded in 982, and some cultural influences from South Asia,
		such as a Sanskrit-based writing system, were carried to the islands by the Indonesian empires of Srivijaya (7th–13th century) and 
		Majapahit (13th–16th century); but in comparison with other parts of the region, the influence of both China and India on the Philippines
		was of little importance. The peoples of the Philippine archipelago, unlike most of the other peoples of Southeast Asia, never adopted 
		Hinduism or Buddhism.</p><br>
	<h2 class="subtitle" style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black";>Pre-Spanish History</h2>
		<p><img class="par"src="finals/pre.jpg" width="200" height="240">
		According to what can be inferred from somewhat later accounts, the Filipinos of the 15th 	century must have engaged primarily in shifting
		cultivation, hunting, and fishing. Sedentary 	cultivation was the exception. Only in the mountains of northern Luzon, where 	elaborate rice 
		terraces were built some 2,000 years ago, were livelihood and social organization 	linked to a fixed territory. The lowland peoples lived in 
		extended kinship groups known 	as barangays, each under the leadership of a datu, or chieftain. The barangay, which ordinarily numbered no more 
		than a few hundred individuals, was usually the largest stable economic and political unit.</p>
	<p>Within the barangay the status system, though not rigid, appears to have consisted of three broad classes: the datu and his family and the nobility,
		freeholders, and “dependents.” This third category consisted of three levels—sharecroppers, debt peons, and war captives—the last two levels being termed 
		“slaves” by Spanish observers. The slave status was inherited but, through manumission and interclass marriage, seldom extended over more than two 
		generations. The fluidity of the social system was in part the consequence of a bilateral kinship system in which lineage was reckoned equally through 
		the male and female lines. Marriage was apparently stable, though divorce was socially acceptable under certain circumstances.</p>
	<p>Early Filipinos followed various local religions, a mixture of monotheism and polytheism in which the latter dominated. The propitiation of spirits 
		required numerous rituals, but there was no obvious religious hierarchy. In religion, as in social structure and economic activity, there was considerable 
		variation between—and even within—islands.</p>
	<p>This pattern began to change in the 15th century, however, when Islam was introduced to Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago through Brunei on the island 
		of Borneo. Along with changes in religious beliefs and practices came new political and social institutions. By the mid-16th century two sultanates had been
		established, bringing under their sway a number of barangays. A powerful datu as far north as Manila embraced Islam. It was in the midst of this wave of 
		Islamic proselytism that the Spanish arrived. Had the Spanish come a century later or had their motives been strictly commercial, Filipinos today might 
		be a predominantly Muslim people.</p><br>
	<h2 class="subtitle" style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black";>The Spanish period</h2>
		<p><img class="par" src="finals/magellan.jpg" width="200" height="240">
		Spanish colonial motives were not, however, strictly commercial. The Spanish at first viewed the Philippines as a stepping-stone to the riches of the 
		East Indies (Spice Islands), but, even after the Portuguese and Dutch had foreclosed that possibility, the Spanish still maintained their presence 
		in the archipelago.</p>
	<p>The Portuguese navigator and explorer Ferdinand Magellan headed the first Spanish foray to the Philippines when he made landfall on Cebu in March 1521;
		a short time later he met an untimely death on the nearby island of Mactan. After King Philip II (for whom the islands are named) had dispatched three further 
		expeditions that ended in disaster, he sent out Miguel López de Legazpi, who established the first permanent Spanish settlement, in Cebu, in 1565. The Spanish 
		city of Manila was founded in 1571, and by the end of the 16th century most of the coastal and lowland areas from Luzon to northern Mindanao were under Spanish 
		control. Friars marched with soldiers and soon accomplished the nominal conversion to Roman Catholicism of all the local people under Spanish administration. 
		But the Muslims of Mindanao and Sulu, whom the Spanish called Moros, were never completely subdued by Spain.</p>
	<p>Spanish rule for the first 100 years was exercised in most areas through a type of tax farming imported from the Americas and known as the encomienda. But 
		abusive treatment of the local tribute payers and neglect of religious instruction by encomenderos (collectors of the tribute), as well as frequent withholding 
		of revenues from the crown, caused the Spanish to abandon the system by the end of the 17th century. The governor-general, himself appointed by the king, began 
		to appoint his own civil and military governors to rule directly.</p>
	<p>Central government in Manila retained a medieval cast until the 19th century, and the governor-general was so powerful that he was often likened to an independent
		monarch. He dominated the Audiencia, or high court, was captain-general of the armed forces, and enjoyed the privilege of engaging in commerce for private profit.
		Manila dominated the islands not only as the political capital. The galleon trade with Acapulco, Mex., assured Manila’s commercial primacy as well. The exchange of 
		Chinese silks for Mexican silver not only kept in Manila those Spanish who were seeking quick profit, but it also attracted a large Chinese community. The Chinese, 
		despite being the victims of periodic massacres at the hands of suspicious Spanish, persisted and soon established a dominance of commerce that survived through the
		centuries.</p>
	<p>Agricultural technology changed very slowly until the late 18th century, as shifting cultivation gradually gave way to more intensive sedentary farming, partly under 
		the guidance of the friars. The socioeconomic consequences of the Spanish policies that accompanied this shift reinforced class differences. The datus and other representatives
		of the old noble class took advantage of the introduction of the Western concept of absolute ownership of land to claim as their own fields cultivated by their various retainers, 
		even though traditional land rights had been limited to usufruct. These heirs of pre-Spanish nobility were known as the principalia and played an important role in the 
		friar-dominated local government.</p><br><br>
	<h2 class="subtitle" style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black";>The Philippines in the 19th Century</h2>
	<p><img class="par" src="finals/noli.jpg" width="200" height="240">
		In 1872 there was a rebellion in Cavite but it was quickly crushed. However nationalist feelings continued to grow helped by a writer named Jose Rizal (1861-1896). 
		He wrote two novels Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The Filibusterer) which stoked the fires of nationalism.</p>
	<p>In 1892 Jose Rizal founded a movement called Liga Filipina, which called for reform rather than revolution. As a result, Rizal was arrested and exiled to 
		Dapitan on Mindanao.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Andres Bonifacio formed a more extreme organization called the Katipunan. In August 1896 they began a revolution. Jose Rizal was accused of supporting the revolution, 
		although he did not and he was executed on 30 December 1896. Yet his execution merely inflamed Filipino opinion and the revolution grew.</p>
	<p>Then in 1898 came the war between the USA and Spain. On 30 April 1898, the Americans defeated the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. Meanwhile, Filipino revolutionaries surrounded Manila.
		Their leader, Emilio Aguinaldo declared the Philippines independent on 12 June. However, as part of the peace treaty, Spain ceded the Philippines to the USA. The Americans planned to take over.
		The war between American forces in Manila and the Filipinos began on 4 February 1899. The Filipino-American War lasted until 1902 when Aguinaldo was captured.</p><br><br>
	<h2 class="subtitle"style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black";>The Philippines in the 20th Century</h2>
	<p>American rule in the Philippines was paternalistic. They called their policy ‘Benevolent Assimilation. They wanted to ‘Americanize’ the Filipinos but they never quite succeeded. 
		   However, they did do some good. Many American teachers were sent to the Philippines in a ship called the Thomas and they did increase literacy.
		   In 1935 the Philippines were made a commonwealth and were semi-independent. Manuel Quezon became president. The USA promised that the Philippines would become completely independent in 1945.However, in December 1941,
		   Japan attacked the US fleet at Pearl Harbor. On 10 December 1941 Japanese troops invaded the Philippines. They captured Manila on 2 January 1941. By 6 May 1942,
		all of the Philippines were in Japanese hands.However American troops returned to the Philippines in October 1944. They recaptured Manila in February 1945.The Philippines became independent on 
		4 July 1946. Manuel Roxas was the first president of the newly independent nation. n Ferdinand Marcos (1917-1989) was elected president in 1965. He was re-elected in 1969. However, the Philippines 
		was dogged by poverty and inequality. In the 1960s a land reform program began. However many peasants were frustrated by its slow progress and a Communist insurgency began in the countryside.</p>
	<p><img class="par" src="finals/marcos.jpg" width="160" height="200">
		On 21 September 1972 Marcos declared martial law. He imposed a curfew, suspended Congress, and arrested opposition leaders.The Marcos dictatorship was exceedingly corrupt and Marcos 
		and his cronies enriched themselves. Then, in 1980 opposition leader Benigno Aquino went into exile in the USA. When he returned on 21 August 1983 he was shot. Aquino became a martyr
		and Filipinos were enraged by his murder. In February 1986 Marcos called an election. The opposition united behind Cory Aquino the widow of Benigno. Marcos claimed victory (a clear case of electoral fraud).
		Cory Aquino also claimed victory and ordinary people took to the streets to show their support for her. The followers of Marcos deserted him and he bowed to the inevitable and went into exile.Things did not
		go smoothly for Corazon Aquino. (She survived 7 coup attempts). Furthermore, the American bases in the Philippines (Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base) were unpopular with many Filipinos who felt they 
		should go. In 1992 Mount Pinatubo erupted and covered Clark in volcanic ash forcing the Americans to leave. They left Subic Bay in 1993.In 1992 Fidel Ramos became president. He improved the infrastructure
		in the Philippines including the electricity supply. Industry was privatized and the economy began to grow more rapidly.However, at the end of the 1990s, the Philippine economy entered a crisis. Meanwhile, in 1998 Joseph Estrada, known as Erap became president. Estrada was accused of corruption and he was impeached 
		in November 2000. Estrada was not convicted. Nevertheless, people demonstrated against him and the military withdrew its support. Estrada was forced to leave office and Vice-president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo
		replaced him. She was re-elected in 2004.</p><br><br>

		<p><img class="par" src="finals/phmap.jpg" width="200" height="240">
		The Philippines is composed of 7,107 separate islands (7,106 during high tide), only 880 of which are inhabited. The three major 
		geographical areas in the Philippines are the large island of Luzon in the north, which includes Manila; the large island of Mindanao
		in the south; and the group of islands lying between them, known as the Visayas. The three stars on the Philippine flag symbolize these 
		three areas.The island geography of the Philippines includes about 21,000 miles of natural coastline. Much of the coastal area is rugged
		and irregular, punctuated by numerous natural harbors and picturesque coves. The Philippines also has some of the most spectacular beaches
		to be found in the South Pacific. Sites that would live up to anyone's fantasy of a pristine South Pacific paradise of white sand beaches and 
		crystal blue waters, they are a popular destination for tourists from around the world. Unfortunately, the heavy pollution and rocky coastline 
		of Manila Bay render the metro Manila area itself unsuited for leisurely Sundays at the beach.</p>
	<p>The interior of the country is generally mountainous, with several mountain peaks reaching almost 10,000 feet. In addition, the Philippines has
		extensive fertile plains along the coast and in the center of the country. It also features lush and scenic rolling hills, with rich valleys 
		crossed by rivers. There are numerous volcanoes in the country, and some are frequently active. The most recent and infamous example was the 
		eruption of Mt. Pinatubo on June 12, 1991, which was the largest volcanic eruption of the century. The Mt. Pinatubo eruption permanently altered 
		the topography of northern Luzon and continues to cause flood control problems.</p>
	<p>Minor earth tremors occur frequently. In 1969 and 1970, major earthquakes hit Manila, resulting in moderate damage and some loss of life. In January 1982,
		an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale hit Northern Bicol. In August 1983, an earthquake measuring 5.7 occurred in Ilocos Norte. Both caused extensive 
		property damage and loss of life. On July 16, 1990, one of the largest and most destructive earthquakes ever to hit the Philippines struck in Central Luzon.
		At its epicenter near Cabanatuan, it measured 8.0 on the Richter scale. This "killer earthquake" caused great destruction and loss of life in Baguio and some 
		other cities of Central Luzon but did not seriously damage Manila.</p>
	<p>The Philippines is a country rich with unique tropical rain forests and coral reefs. It has been referred to as the Galapagos Islands times ten. It hosts more 
		than 510 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians that exist nowhere else on earth. The country is also on the East Asian Migratory Flyway for birds 
		that travel from the south pole to the north pole and back again each year. The Olango Island Wildlife Sanctuary, just minutes from Cebu City, has won international 
		ecotourism awards for its educational tours and conservation efforts. Scuba diving and snorkeling on the biologically diverse coral reefs are also popular activities,
		with good resorts and coral reefs within driving distance from Manila.Less than 18% of the land area remains covered by forests-only about 5 million hectares.
		And only 800,000 hectares of this forest is considered old growth forest. These natural resources provide the basis for food security and employment for millions of 
		Filipinos.</p><br><br>
	<h2 class="subtitle" style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black";  "overflow-x: hidden";>Environment/Climate:</h2>
	<p><img class="par" src="finals/envi.jpg" width="200" height="240">
		The Philippines has a tropical climate, but it is marginally less hot and humid than many tropical countries for most of the year. Although the sun shines almost year 
		round, there are slight seasonal variations in the weather. The dry summer season, which runs from about late April to early June is hot and humid and with little 
		rainfall. The typhoon season runs from June to September, with frequent drenching rains that can temper the heat somewhat but also preclude any outdoor activities.
		The downpours are often limited in duration, but the resulting flash floods can create chaos by blocking streets, stranding motorists, and bringing the already 
		congested traffic of Manila to a virtual standstill. The most pleasant season follows the rainy season, from November until March. During this time of year, mornings
		can be fresh, and even the midday temperatures remain bearable, with frequent breezes that temper the heat.</p>
	<p>The temperature range in Manila is relatively narrow, with minimum temperatures in the mid-70s and highs in the mid-90s, and an annual mean of about 80°F. Average 
		relative humidity ranges from 69% in April to 84% in August or September. Baguio, the original summer capital of the Philippines, is located 155 miles north of Manila 
		at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The climate varies between the dry and the very wet season, each lasting about six months. The dry season runs from December to May,
		with temperatures ranging from the 50s and 60s at night to highs in the mid-80s during the day. Baguio averages 176 inches of rainfall a year, about half of which falls 
		in July and August alone. The rains begin tapering off in September and are light in October and November. </p><br>

	<p><img class="par" src="finals/demographics.jpg" width="200" height="240">
		The Philippines is an ethnically diverse country that is in the early stages of demographic transition.  Its fertility rate has dropped 
		steadily since the 1950s.  The decline was more rapid after the introduction of a national population program in the 1970s in large part due
		to the increased use of modern contraceptive methods, but fertility has decreased more slowly in recent years.  The country’s total fertility rate (TFR) 
		– the average number of births per woman – dropped below 5 in the 1980s, below 4 in the 1990s, and below 3 in the 2010s. 
		TFR continues to be above replacement level at 2.9 and even higher among the poor, rural residents, and the less-educated. 
		Significant reasons for elevated TFR are the desire for more than two children, in part because children are a means of financial
		assistance and security for parents as they age, particularly among the poor.</p>
	<p>The Philippines are the source of one of the world’s largest emigrant populations, much of which consists of legal temporary workers known as Overseas
		Foreign Workers or OFWs.  As of 2019, there were 2.2 million OFWs.  They work in a wide array of fields, most frequently in services 
		(such as caregivers and domestic work), skilled trades, and construction but also in professional fields, including nursing and engineering. 
		OFWs most often migrate to Middle Eastern countries, but other popular destinations include Hong Kong, China, and Singapore, as well as employment on ships. 
		Filipino seafarers make up 35-40% of the world’s seafarers, as of 2014.   Women OFWs, who work primarily in domestic services and entertainment, 
		have outnumbered men since 1992. </p>
	<p>Migration and remittances have been a feature of Philippine culture for decades.  The government has encouraged and facilitated emigration, regulating recruitment 
		agencies and adopting legislation to protect the rights of migrant workers.  Filipinos began emigrating to the US and Hawaii early in the 20th century.  In 1934, 
		US legislation limited Filipinos to 50 visas per year except during labor shortages, causing emigration to plummet.  It was not until the 1960s, when the US and other
		destination countries – Canada, Australia, and New Zealand – loosened their immigration policies, that Filipino emigration expanded and diversified.  The government 
		implemented an overseas employment program in the 1970s, promoting Filipino labor to Gulf countries needing more workers for their oil industries.  Filipino emigration 
		increased rapidly.  The government had intended for international migration to be temporary, but a lack of jobs and poor wages domestically, the ongoing demand for 
		workers in the Gulf countries, and new labor markets in Asia continue to spur Philippine emigration. </p><br>

	<p><img class="par" src="finals/cultureph.jpg" width="200" height="240">
		There is significant cultural diversity across the islands, reinforced by the fragmented geography of the country.
		The cultures within Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago developed in a particularly distinct manner, since they had very
		limited Spanish influence and greater influence from nearby Islamic regions.[537] Despite this, a national identity emerged
		in the 19th century, the development of which is represented by shared national symbols and other cultural and historical 
		touchstones.</p>
	<p>One of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname,
		however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came as a result of a 
		colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua, which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and
		implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population. The names of many locations are also Spanish or stem from Spanish
		roots and origins.</p>
	<p>There is a substantial American influence on modern Filipino culture. The common use of the English language is an example of 
		the American impact on Philippine society. It has contributed to the influence of American pop cultural trends.
		This affinity is seen in Filipinos' consumption of fast food and American film and music.
		American global fast-food chain stalwarts have entered the market, but local fast-food chains like Goldilocks
		and most notably Jollibee, the leading fast-food chain in the country, have emerged and compete successfully against
		foreign chains. Nationwide festivals include Ati-Atihan, Dinagyang, Moriones and Sinulog.</p>

	<h2 class="subtitle" style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black";>Values</h2>
	<p><img class="par" src="finals/values.jpg" width="200" height="140">
		As a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those 
		based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity), and commercial relationships. Filipino values are,
		for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. 
		The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of "Hiya", roughly translated as 'a sense of shame',
		and "Amor propio" or 'self-esteem'.[549] Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. 
		Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos.
		Other elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events,
		concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature,
		respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating
		and thievery.</p><br><br>	
	<h2  class="subtitle" style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black";>Architecture</h2>
	<p><img class="par" src="finals/arki.jpg" width="200" height="200">
		Spanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor,
		but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II. Four Philippine baroque churches are included in 
		the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the San Agustín Church in Manila, Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte, Nuestra Señora de la Asunción 
		(Santa María) Church in Ilocos Sur, and Santo Tomás de Villanueva Church in Iloilo. Vigan in Ilocos Sur is known for the many 
		Hispanic-style houses and buildings preserved there.
		American rule introduced new architectural styles. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. 
		During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham
		was done on the portions of the city of Manila. Part of the Burnham plan was the construction of government buildings that 
		resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture.[555] In Iloilo, structures from both the Spanish and American periods can still be
		seen, especially in Calle Real. Certain areas of the country like Batanes have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipinos of architecture assimilated differently because of the climate. Limestone was used as a building material, with houses being built 
		to withstand typhoons.</p><br><br>
	<h2 class="subtitle" style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black"; >Music and dance</h2>	
	<p><img class="par" src="finals/music.jpg" width="200" height="210">
		In general, there are two types of Philippine folk dance, stemming from traditional tribal influences and from Spanish influence. Spanish-influenced 
		music are mostly bandurria-based bands that us 14th string guitars. One example of such type is the Cariñosa. A Hispanic Filipino dance, 
		unofficially considered as the "National Dance of the Philippines". Another example is the Tinikling. While native dances had
		become less popular over time,a revival of folk dances began in the 1920s. In the modern and post-modern
		time periods, dances may vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing.
		During the Spanish era Rondalya music, where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used, was widespread.
		Kundiman developed in the 1920s and 1930s[564] and had a renaissance in the postwar period. The American colonial period exposed
		many Filipinos to U.S. culture and popular forms of music. Rock music was introduced to Filipinos in the 1960s and developed into
		Filipino rock, or "Pinoy rock", a term encompassing diverse styles such as pop rock, alternative rock, heavy metal, punk, new wave,
		ska, and reggae. Martial law in the 1970s produced several Filipino folk rock bands and artists who were at the forefront of 
		political demonstrations. The 1970s also saw the birth of Manila Sound and Original Pilipino Music (OPM).
		Filipino hip-hop traces its origins back to 1979, entering the mainstream in 1990. Karaoke is a popular activity in the country.
		From 2010 to 2020, Philippine pop music or P-pop went through a metamorphosis in its increased quality, budget, investment, 
		and variety, matching the country's rapid economic growth and an accompanying social and cultural resurgence of its Asian
		identity. This was heard by heavy influence from K-pop and J-pop, growth in Asian style ballads, idol groups, and electronic
		dance music, and less reliance on Western genres, mirroring the Korean wave and similar Japanese wave popularity among 
		millennial Filipinos and mainstream culture.</p><br><br>
	<h2 class="subtitle" style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black";>Literature</h2>
	<p><img class="par" src="finals/rizal.png" width="200" height="180">
		Philippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino, Spanish, or English. Some of the most known were created from
		the 17th to 19th century. Ibong Adarna, for example, is a famous epic about an eponymous magical bird allegedly written by 
		José de la Cruz or "Huseng Sisiw". Francisco Balagtas, the poet and playwright who wrote Florante at Laura, is recognized as
		a preeminent writer in the Tagalog language. José Rizal wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (Touch Me Not) and El filibusterismo
		(The Filibustering, also known as The Reign of Greed). The term "Philippine literature" refers to works of literature that 
		have been connected to the country throughout prehistory through the colonial era and up to the present. Epics that were 
		originally passed down orally are what can be considered pre-Hispanic Philippine literature. However, wealthier families were
		able to preserve transcriptions of these epics as family heirlooms, particularly in Mindanao. The Darangen, a Maranao epic, 
		was one such example.Philippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the 
		Filipino people. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling, Lam-Ang, and the Sarimanok.
		</p><br><br>
	<h2 class="subtitle" style="font-family:Georgia";"color:black";>Cuisine</h2>	
	<p><img class="par" src="finals/cuisine.png" width="200" height="200">
		Regional variations exist throughout the islands, for example rice is a standard starch in Luzon while cassava is more common in 
		Mindanao.[614] Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors[615] centered on sweet, salty, and sour combinations.
		Unlike many Asians, most Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. Since rice is the primary staple 
		food and stews and broths are very common in Filipino cuisine, the main of utensils are spoons and forks, not knife and fork.
		The traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan (using the hand for bringing food to the mouth)was previously more 
		often seen in the less urbanized areas. Introduction of Filipino food to people of other nationalities, as well as to 
		Filipino urbanites, has popularized kamayan. This recent trend also sometimes incorporates the "boodle fight" concept 
		(as popularized and coined by the Philippine Army), wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions
		and Filipino viands are placed all together for a filial, friendly or communal kamayan feasting.
		Due to the numerous Latin American and Spanish foods imported to the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period, Philippine cuisine has changed 
		over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to a diversified cuisine with many Hispanic cultural influences. 
		Additionally, it has been influenced in varied degrees by American, Chinese, and other Asian cuisines. The three meals that
		Filipinos eat each day—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—are supplemented by meryenda, or snacks.
